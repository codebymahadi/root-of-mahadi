Born on June 11, 2008 – young, curious, and passionate about building cool stuff on the web.

I started my journey into web development with guidance from Apna College, and ever since then, I've been diving deep into the world of code, creativity, and continuous learning.

I'm currently learning and experimenting with:

🌐 HTML, CSS, JavaScript

⚛️ React (soon!)

💡 Building projects to sharpen my skills

This repository is a place where I document my journey, share who I am, and reflect on where I'm headed in tech. 🚀
